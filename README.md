# Protein Structure Prediction of Hemoglobin Subunit Beta

## Overview
This project presents the prediction and visualization of the three-dimensional structure of the human Hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB). The structure was obtained using AlphaFold DB and visualized using PyMOL to analyze its secondary structural features.

## Protein Information
- **Protein Name:** Hemoglobin Subunit Beta  
- **UniProt ID:** P68871  
- **Organism:** Homo sapiens  

## Tools and Databases Used
- **UniProt** – Protein sequence retrieval  
- **AlphaFold DB** – Protein structure prediction  
- **PyMOL** – Molecular visualization and structural analysis  

## Methodology
1. The amino acid sequence of Hemoglobin subunit beta was retrieved from the UniProt database.
2. The predicted three-dimensional structure was obtained from AlphaFold DB in PDB format.
3. The structure was visualized in PyMOL using cartoon representation.
4. Coloring by secondary structure was applied to highlight alpha-helical regions.
5. Multiple orientations of the structure were examined to understand the overall fold.

## Results
The predicted structure exhibits a compact globular fold and is predominantly composed of alpha helices, consistent with known hemoglobin protein architecture.

Screenshots demonstrating cartoon representation, secondary structure coloring, and rotated views are provided in the `Screenshots` folder.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of computational bioinformatics tools for protein structure prediction and visualization, highlighting the importance of structural analysis in understanding protein function.
